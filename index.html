    <h1>Bananas</h1>
    <h2>Technically a berry!</h2>
    <h3>A website about bananas</h3>
    <p>Banana flavored candies like Laffy Taffy are flavored like bananas that are now nearly <em>extinct</em>(not that I really mind, they are really not my favorite flavor anyway). The Gros Michel varietal was almost wiped out by a banana fungus, which was then replaced in grocery stores by the fungal-resistant Cavendish banana we all know and(some) love today.</p>

    <p>In *Curious George* by H.A. Rey and Margret Rey, the main character Curious George eats a lot of bananas, though it is unclear what varietal he prefers.</p>

    <h3>Banana types</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Cavendish(The one you may or may not<br>have rotting on your counter right now)</li>

        <li>Lady's Finger</li>
        <li>Red Banana</li>
        <li>Pisang Raja</li>

    <h3>We should all be socialists</h3>
    <p>Though monocultures are prevalent due to the evils of capitalism, many farmers pursue biodiversity as a method of preserving and investing in our planet and the resident species' futures.</p>
